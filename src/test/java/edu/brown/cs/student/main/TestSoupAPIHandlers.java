/**
 * Test the actual handlers.
 *
 * <p>On Sprint 2, you'll need to deserialize API responses. Although this demo doesn't need to do
 * that, these _tests_ do.
 *
 * <p>https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/
 *
 * <p>Because these tests exercise more than one "unit" of code, they're not "unit tests"...
 *
 * <p>If the backend were "the system", we might call these system tests. But I prefer "integration
 * test" since, locally, we're testing how the Soup functionality connects to the handler. These
 * distinctions are sometimes fuzzy and always debatable; the important thing is that these ARE NOT
 * the usual sort of unit tests.
 *
 * <p>Note: if we were doing this for real, we might want to test encoding formats other than UTF-8
 * (StandardCharsets.UTF_8).
